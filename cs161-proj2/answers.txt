1. What is the current Bitcoin mining difficulty? (You can find it online at
https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty.)
The current Bitcoin mining difficulty is 60,883,825,480. The next estimated difficutly is 63,413,802,702.


2. How long does your computer take to mine a block? We don't need a precise answer.

My computer takes about 30 seconds to 2 minutes to mine a block.


3. The quantity difficulty√ó2^32 is the expected number of hash iterations needed to mine a Bitcoin block. How long would it take for your computer to mine a Bitcoin block, if a Bitcoin hash operation takes the same amount of time as a hash operation in your code for this project?



4. The Bitcoin difficulty is dynamically tuned so that it takes on average 10 minutes to mine a block. A DES key is 56 bits long. How long does it take the current Bitcoin network to compute 2^56 hash operations?
